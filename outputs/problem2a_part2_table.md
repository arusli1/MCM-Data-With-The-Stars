# Part 2: Which Input Dominates? (Fan Advantage Summary)

| Method | Mean Fan Advantage | Fans Dominate | Judges Dominate |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Rank | 0.56 | 22/34 (65%) | 12/34 (35%) |
| Percent | 0.67 | 23/34 (68%) | 11/34 (32%) |

**Fan Advantage** = (Judges displacement from combined) − (Fans displacement from combined). Positive = fans dominate.

**Rank Favor Magnitude** (interpretable effect size): fan_advantage_rank − fan_advantage_percent. 
Mean = -0.103 ± 0.442 displacement units. Positive = rank gives fans more advantage than percent.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Seasons where rank favors fans more | 1/34 (3%) |
| Mean rank favor magnitude | -0.103 displacement units |
