## Viewership vs. Controversy Analysis

**Data sources:** Wikipedia (viewership per episode), Problem 2b (GMM controversial count).

**Seasons:** 34
**Pearson r:** -0.028 (p = 0.8767)
**Spearman ρ:** -0.062 (p = 0.7288)

**Interpretation:** No strong linear correlation: controversy count does not clearly predict viewership.

**Limitations:** Viewership declines over time (cord-cutting); controversy is rare (21 total).
Season-level confounding (year, competition) limits causal inference.
