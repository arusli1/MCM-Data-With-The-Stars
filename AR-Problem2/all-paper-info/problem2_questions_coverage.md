# Problem 2: Coverage of Problem Questions

Maps the problem questions to files in `all-paper-info` and provides direct answers.

## Question 1: Rank vs Percent Across Seasons

**Problem asks:** Compare and contrast rank vs percent across seasons. If differences exist, does one method favor fan votes more than the other?

### Direct Answers

| Finding | Source | Location |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Same winner 26/34 (76%); same top 4 23/34 (68%) | Part 1 | `problem2a_part1_table.md` |
| Mean Kendall τ 0.082; mean displacement 0.80 | Part 1 | `problem2a_part1_table.md` |
| **Rank favors fans more** in 24/34 seasons | Part 2 | `problem2a_part2_table.md`, `paper_2a_explanation.md` |
| Rank favor magnitude: 0.75 ± 0.94 displacement units | Part 2 | `problem2a_part2_table.md` |
| Fan advantage: Rank −0.23, Percent −0.97 (judges dominate more under percent) | Part 2 | `problem2a_part2_table.md` |

### Files

- `paper_2a_explanation.md` — methods, assumptions, results, limitations, conclusions
- `problem2a_part1_table.md` — per-season Kendall τ, displacement, winner same, top4 same
- `problem2a_part2_table.md` — fan advantage, rank favor magnitude, Part 3 bottom-2
- `problem2a_part1_displacement.pdf`, `problem2a_evolution.pdf`, `problem2a_combined_evolution_bottom2.pdf` (in all-paper-info)
- `methods_overview.md` — structure of rank vs percent, fan advantage

**Conclusion:** Yes. Rank favors fan votes more than percent. Percent is more judge-dominated.

## Question 2: Controversy Examples — Method Choice & Judge-Save

**Problem asks:** For controversial celebrities (Jerry Rice, Billy Ray Cyrus, Bristol Palin, Bobby Bones), would method choice have led to the same result? How would judge-save (judges pick bottom 2) impact results?

### All Controversial Contestants: Full List

See **`problem2b_table.md`** for the complete table of all 21 controversial contestants with: Season, Name, Type (fan/judge favored), Judge Pct, Place Pct, Actual placement, Rank placement, Percent placement, Same RvP?, Judge-save impacted?

**Named examples (bold in table):**
- **Jerry Rice (S2):** Same result under all regimes (2nd). Method choice and judge-save: no impact.
- **Billy Ray Cyrus (S4):** Rank → 7th; Percent → 5th. Method choice matters (percent closer to actual).
- **Bristol Palin (S11):** Rank → 7th; Percent → 3rd. Method choice matters (percent matches actual).
- **Bobby Bones (S27):** Rank → 3rd; Percent → 1st (winner). Method choice matters (percent matches actual; under rank, Evanna Lynch would win).

**Judge-save impacted:** 2 contestants (Iman Shumpert S30, Whitney Leavitt S34). Overall: 6 of 44 bottom-two weeks.

### Files

- `problem2b_table.md` — **full list of all 21 controversial contestants** with regime placements
- `paper_2b_explanation.md` — controversy method, GMM (consolidated), regime results, limitations
- `problem2b_controversy_cdf.pdf`, `problem2b_controversy_scatter.pdf`, `problem2b_regime_controversy_by_type.pdf` (in all-paper-info)

**Note:** Per-contestant regime placements come from `outputs/problem2b_2x2_scenarios.csv` (not in all-paper-info; regenerated by `python3 problem2b_controversy.py`).

## Minor Gaps

1. **Per-example regime table** — The table above is now in this document. Consider copying a trimmed version into `problem2b_table.md` or keeping it here.
2. **Raw 2×2 scenarios** — `problem2b_2x2_scenarios.csv` lives in `outputs/`, not `all-paper-info`. Regenerate with `python3 problem2b_controversy.py` if needed.
