# Threshold Sensitivity Analysis (Problem 2b)

| Threshold | N Controversial | Fan Favored | Judge Favored | Known Examples In |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 0.25 | 53 | 32 | 21 | 4/4 |
| 0.30 | 30 | 19 | 11 | 4/4 |
| 0.33 | 27 | 17 | 10 | 4/4 |
| 0.35 | 21 | 13 | 8 | 4/4 |
| 0.36 | 20 | 12 | 8 | 4/4 |
| 0.37 | 15 | 9 | 6 | 3/4 |
| 0.40 | 13 | 8 | 5 | 2/4 |

**Conclusion:** Main findings (method choice has minimal impact, judge-save affects few cases) are robust across thresholds 0.30–0.40. GMM classification (main analysis) is data-driven.
