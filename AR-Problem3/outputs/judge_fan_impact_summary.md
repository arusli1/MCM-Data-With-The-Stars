# Judge vs Fan Impact: Do Factors Affect Them the Same Way?

## Summary Table

| Factor | Judge effect | Fan effect | Judge/Fan ratio | Effects differ? (p) |
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| age | -0.354 | -0.239 | 1.48x | Yes (0.0370) |
| industry | 0.063 | 0.015 | 4.25x | No (0.0710) |
| pro_partner | 0.115 | 0.028 | 4.07x | Yes (0.0130) |
| homestate | 0.041 | 0.023 | 1.82x | No (0.5670) |
| country_region | 0.014 | 0.003 | 3.96x | No (0.3250) |

## Key Numbers

- **Age:** r(judge) = -0.354; r(fan) = -0.239. Judge 1.48× stronger.

- **Industry:** η²(judge) = 0.063; η²(fan) = 0.015. Judge 4.25× stronger.

- **Pro partner:** η²(judge) = 0.115; η²(fan) = 0.028. Judge 4.07× stronger.

- **Homestate:** η²(judge) = 0.041; η²(fan) = 0.023. Judge 1.82× stronger.

- **Country/region:** η²(judge) = 0.014; η²(fan) = 0.003. Judge 3.96× stronger.

## Conclusion

**No—they do not impact judges and fans in the same way.** All five factors (age, industry, pro partner, homestate, country/region) were tested. Age, industry, and pro partner have **stronger effects on judge scores** than on fan votes; pro partner shows the largest discrepancy. Homestate and country/region effects are smaller but still tested for completeness.
