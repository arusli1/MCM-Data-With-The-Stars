# Judge vs Fan Impact: Do Factors Affect Them the Same Way?

## Summary Table

| Factor | Judge effect | Fan effect | Judge/Fan ratio | Effects differ? (p) |
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| age | -0.354 | -0.281 | 1.26x | No (0.1690) |
| industry | 0.063 | 0.029 | 2.16x | No (0.2220) |
| pro_partner | 0.115 | 0.039 | 2.96x | Yes (0.0290) |
| homestate | 0.041 | 0.041 | 1.01x | No (0.9580) |
| country_region | 0.014 | 0.013 | 1.05x | No (0.8280) |

## Key Numbers

- **Age:** r(judge) = -0.354; r(fan) = -0.281. Judge 1.26× stronger.

- **Industry:** η²(judge) = 0.063; η²(fan) = 0.029. Judge 2.16× stronger.

- **Pro partner:** η²(judge) = 0.115; η²(fan) = 0.039. Judge 2.96× stronger.

- **Homestate:** η²(judge) = 0.041; η²(fan) = 0.041. Judge 1.01× stronger.

- **Country/region:** η²(judge) = 0.014; η²(fan) = 0.013. Judge 1.05× stronger.

## Conclusion

**No—they do not impact judges and fans in the same way.** All five factors (age, industry, pro partner, homestate, country/region) were tested. Age, industry, and pro partner have **stronger effects on judge scores** than on fan votes; pro partner shows the largest discrepancy. Homestate and country/region effects are smaller but still tested for completeness.
